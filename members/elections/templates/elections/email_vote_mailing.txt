Please select your 5 preferred candidates from the list of nominees.

Once the votes have been cast for your organization, this form will disappear and you will see confirmation of your votes.

Open Education Global by-laws require us to have 10 Board of Directors chosen by members. This year we need to elect 5 new Board members. To ensure we get the necessary 5 new Board members we ask OEG members to cast all 5 votes. This will also help ensure we get a diverse and inclusive Board with representation from around the world. To inform your decision making about who to vote for we invite you to review the information about each candidate at

https://www.oeconsortium.org/about-oec/membership/elections/

All voting takes place online.

The election period ends April 2. Results will be announced April 11.
